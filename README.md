# 👘 Apparel Platform Performance Analysis

## 📈 Overview
This project builds predictive models to estimate customer spending on an apparel platform. Through careful EDA and feature engineering, it uncovers key drivers of customer purchases.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Length of Membership** has the strongest influence: each extra unit leads to **$61.27 more spent**.
- **Time on App** drives spending by **$38.59 per unit**, while **Time on Website** has minimal impact.
- Highlights the value of app engagement and loyalty strategies to grow revenue.

## 🤖 Model Comparison & Learnings
| Model                | What We Learned                                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Best fit for this problem; simple, effective, captured the linear relationship well. |
| **Ridge Regression**  | Helped confirm the stability of linear patterns |
| **Decision Tree**     | Did not outperform simpler models; risked overfitting without better predictive power. |
| **Random Forest**     | More complex, but didn’t improve accuracy here — showed that complexity isn't always better. |

## 🚀 Final Model Performance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **MAE** | 7.23 |
| **MSE** | 79.81 |
| **RMSE** | 8.93 |



## 🛠 Tech Stack
